# Prisoners-Of-War
This is a game that mixestug of war and dodgeball. 
The player plays as either the Russians or US in a alternative history world where Adolf Hitler became an artist instead of a the Nazi party leader, and the Cold War escalated to full out war. 
As the player, you fight with another person in a local co-op map, for control of no man's land in a major city (use your imagination for which one). 
No man's land is marked in the middle of the game by a crack in the pavement, as you kill the other player more, you gain ground, once the other player loses all of his land (the crack has moved to the edge of their side), they lose, and you hear an epic song declaring that you are the victor.
